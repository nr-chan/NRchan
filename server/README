nrchan-server is a cf-workers project written entirely in Go, compiled to
WebAssembly using the `syumai/workers` library. It uses D1 SQL as the database
and R2 for object storage.

To run locally, install wrangler and log in:

    npm install -g wrangler
    npx wrangler login

Start the development server:

    npm start

To deploy the server:

    npm run deploy

The Go code follows clean architecture and is compiled automatically into WASM
during the Worker build process. MongoDB is no longer used; all storage is now
handled via D1 and R2.

Production deployment is available at:
